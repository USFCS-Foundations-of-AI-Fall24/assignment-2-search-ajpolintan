Question 1: Algorithms. /10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - I don't think you're handling depth right;
you increment it for each successor, rather than setting
a node's depth to be parent + 1

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 15/15

count states: 5/5

Question 4: 10/10

Question 5: 10/10 great explanation!
